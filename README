CHIP8 Emulator

This is a simple emulator designed to interpret and run programs written for the
the CHIP8 instruction set and architecture.

The reference http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/
was used to help getting started with writing this program.
In addition, the CHIP8 wikipedia entry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) was
immensely helpful in finding the various instruction definitions.

Usage is simple. Simply run 'make' inside the source directory. This will
generate the 'main' object file, This can be run, giving the path to your CHIP8
program as the argument:
  ./main ~/path/to/foo.ch8 (--<debug_flag>)

'make clean' will delete all the object files.

NOTE:
This implementation outputs the graphics using SDL, so the requisite SDL libs
must be installed on the machine, to ensure it compiles successfully. You can
set SDL up easily by perusing https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation

MISC:
- Verbose logging can be enabled using the '--debug' option. There are three
  settings possible (debug, info, warning), and the default is 'info'.
- The scale of the output window can be changed by modifying the GFX_SCALE
  macro inside the chip8.h header file.
- SDL can be switched off by setting the SDL flag in chip8.h to 0. This, along
  with the '--debug' command line flag, will enable the graphics buffer to be
  printed as an ASCII array, whenever a draw instruction is encountered.
- Currently, the Key event handler isn't asynchronous. Ideally that would be
  desirable, but the keyboard response time seemed to be sufficient enough that
  it was decided to forego the extra complexity. That said, this would be an
  improvement.

Special thanks to Dmitry Grinberg for helping out with the graphics window
scaling!
